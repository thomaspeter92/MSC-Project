hbo rocks), doctor who, the bbc top gear even though i'm not into cars, battlestar galactica, breaking bad, arrested development, 30 rock, firefly, aqua teen hunger force, archer, trailer park boys. by the way: i hate lost. don't get me started.  music: the mars volta (i have played the new leaked album to death already), pendulum, justice, the glitch mob, the cinematic orchestra, zion i, the grouch, living legends, florence + the machine, mumford and sons, alex clare, gotye, adele. i like most top 40 alternative rock/pop nonsense. right now i have ""too close"" by alex clare stuck in my head.  food: pretty much anything. i'm not a fan of olives. organ meats kinda freak me out, but i will try new stuff if i'm in the right mood.  movies: almost anything by p. t. anderson, wes anderson (both of whom have movies coming out soon, so excited!!!), and the coen brothers. i loved drive and hugo. man with a movie camera is one of my editing inspirations. i like horror movies (even though i still occasionally get freaked out going to the bathroom at night thanks to paranormal activity). i like quirky, oddball comedies/dramadies. laughter (friends & family) burbon or beer coffee the internet thumbs. they're awesome. hbo, amc and british television  is that more than 6?

=) living life one day at a time. broadening my horizons by visiting new places in the bay area and learning their history. im currently working on a degree in multimedia arts for now. going out to bay area events and taking tons of photos( recently shot bay to breakers). playing video games every now and then. trying to play catch-up for the 3 years i was totally out of the loop. riding public transportation and enjoying the views and the experience that comes with it. bicycling around the east bay enjoying the beautiful resources the bay area shines with, the bay birds flying by cars zipping along i580. i'm not entirely sure where ill go or what ill end up doing but i hope its beautiful and rewarding. photography, communication, computers, sign language technology growing things, gardening bay area transit public transit bicycling videography history of the bay area understanding highway and freeway networks as well as the us interstates , state routes and bridges making youtube videos  being at the right place at the right time and capturing a video of something terrible like a bus crash or an open door train on muni, or a muni driver smoking inside of a muni train collecting things video editing sound editing finding deals and saving money taking lots of showers helping others learning about specific topics that interest me self advocating  standing up for whats right and not letting people put me or others down rushing procrastinating sign language editing photos keeping up with current events im usually pretty happy and all smiles. i'm polite and able to relatable to a wide range of topics. my eyes are blue. as far as books go i dont have favorites necessarily here are some books ive read in the past and some i really like, dont laugh!

let's talk. changing the world, one group at a time. having as much fun as i can. trying to get out of debt that i don't really care about. loving deeply and truly. fixing things. moderating groups. teaching stuff. being kind. figuring things out. taking care of others. driving fast. making people feel safe. getting people to talk. making folks feel cared about. being comfortable in my own skin. height/stature face  i forgot to mention that can apparently be intimidating... this gets brought up to me pretty regularly when folks first meet me. c'mon look at my pics, that's not an intimidating face... is it?
